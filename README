Introduction
--------------------


This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I made using jRuby and Java's Swing for study.

I intend do make this game online with java sockets. But first I'll get this working offline. =D



TODOs
--------------------

I'll list here some of the TODO's for the first release:

 -> Implement the recursive algorithm for validating the game board;
 -> Make a better HUD;
